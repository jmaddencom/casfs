# casfs
An old proto-implementation of a filesystem backed by Cassandra, written in perl of all things

It's slow, PoC-only, single-threaded, not fully implemented, and I haven't even looked at any of it since probably 2012. But still, it was a fun thing to workon IIRC. It hasn't been tested with any modern versions of Cassandra and will almost certainly lose any data you write to it.
